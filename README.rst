======================
Linfiniti Sphinx Theme
======================

This is a theme for the `sphinx documentation system
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ based on the `bootstrap css framework
<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_. It also uses a few icons from the
free `34aL volume 3.2 SE<http://www.icojoy.com/articles/26/>`_ icon set.

The base layout.html is taken from the default sphinx theme and modified.
